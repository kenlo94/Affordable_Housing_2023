# Affordable_Housing_2023

Segment 2: Deliverable

I chose the Linear regression model to be able to represent the visual of the data. While the inital thought was that the simplicity of the linear regression model would allow for a simple yet accurate representation of the data, I was wrong. The complexity of our project calls for a machine learning model that is more advanced. My team hypothesized that the 2008 housing crash skewed our results. Initial findings were inaccurate and did not answer our question effectively. After focusing on data from 2010 and up, it allowed to have a better grasp of the results and thus have more concrete findings. While my linear regression model can help paint a picture of the idea that we were attempting to strive for, it does not truly represent the full scope of our project. My hypothesis is that we will need a combination of logistical regression and deep learning to find the answers to our questions of affordability.
