# Affordable_Housing_2023
## Overview 

Initially, our group wanted to find affordable housing in all of California. For this deliverable, I have decided to focus on just one location, San Joaquin County. We defined the term "affordable" as 30% of the Average Yearly Income using a down payment of 20% with a 30-yr fixed interest rate at 5%. Since I was mainly focused on the San Joaquin County, I also considered mortgage rates in California with an applicant whose credit score was between 700-719. I used the 2020 Average Yearly Income data for San Joaquin County which was calculated as $49,300 or $1,233 monthly. This means the applicant is able to afford a home costing roughly $280,000 not including taxes and insurance.
