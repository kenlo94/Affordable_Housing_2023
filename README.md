## Affordable_Housing_2023

This project aims to see if it is possible to develop a Machine Learning or Deep Learning model that can predict house values in California counties with a high probability or low error, using historical data from many sources connected to this economic sector.

- Migration data - www.census.gov
- Wages increase during past 20 years - IRS.gov / https://fred.stlouisfed.org/
- House price below 300k - Zillow Public Database
- Median age of population - www.census.gov
- Crime statistics - FBI
- Relation annual salary / house price
- Weather - NCDC https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/
- Local economic grow forecast - https://fred.stlouisfed.org/
- Plans on data cleaning (if needed)

Once the datasets are downloaded from each database, we will check for:

- Null values
- Correct data types
- Fixing columns
- Checking duplicates and misspelling
- Initial list of modules/libraries you intend to use
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Plotly
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Tableau
- SQL
- TensorFlow
